        "details": "Hospital services make up the core of a hospital's offerings. They are often shaped by the needs or wishes of its major users to make the hospital a one-stop or core institution of its local commun ity or medical network. Hospitals are institutions comprising basic services and personnel—usually departments of medicine and surgery—that administer clinical and other services for specific diseases and conditions, as well as emergency services. Hospital services cover a range of medical offerings from basic health care necessities or training and research for major medical school centers to services designed by an industry-owned network of such institutions as health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The mix of services that a hospital may offer depends almost entirely upon its basic mission(s) or objective(s)."

        "details":"Over the past two decades, hospital services in the United States have declined markedly as a percentage of health care costs, from 43.5% in 1980 to 32.8% in 2000. This decline was due to shortened lengths of hospital stay, the move from inpatient to outpatient facilities for surgery, and a wave of hospital mergers in the 1990s that consolidated services and staff. Since 2001, however, spending on hospital care in the United States has been growing faster than other sectors of the economy as a result of increasing demand for hospital services. Forty percent of the rise in spending on hospital care is due to escalating costs for hospital services attributed to population growth, the aging of the general population, and growing discontent with the limitations imposed by managed care. In addition, new medical technologies have allowed hospitals to provide life-saving diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives that were unavailable in the 1990s."

Intravenous medications are usually begun in the patient's room before surgery to relax the patient, with general anesthesia administered in the operating room ."
